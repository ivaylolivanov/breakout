# Simple Breakout implementation in plain Javascript

The game is written entirely in pure JavaScript and is rendered on HTML5 <canvas>.

## The project follows the [MDN tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript) for simple Breakout implementation in pure JS.

While the source for the game mainly follows the steps from the tutorial, there are introduced changes:

- The structure of the code
- The end of the game
- Some of the rendering was modified to look better

The game is tested only in firefox

## To run the game:

- git clone https://github.com/m00ns7ruck/breakout.git
- start index.html
